# Perceptron
Hi, this is a simple perceptron. 
# What is a perceptron?
A perceptron is a single model of an artificial neuron. Perceptrons are used for classification problems. 
This perceptron can classify a jungle cat, from a sand cat, by entering weight and height as inputs.
This is just an example, but you can modify the dataset as you want, for example classify a cat from a dog.
